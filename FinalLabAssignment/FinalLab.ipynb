    "The assignment consists of **two phases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preparation Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "During the preparation phase you compile all relevant code and information to solve a classification task using below steps. To do so please revise the lab assignments of this course and note the collected information in the repective cells below. Please make sure to put this information in the \"raw\" cells and not in executable code cells. Please do not forget to equally collect all required `import` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation is considered an integral part of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Final Lab Assignment Session\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a regular lab session of 90 minutes. \n",
    "At the beginning of the session you will receive the data to work on. The data file will be made available in the `data` folder. Both lab sections will receive different data sets! The code as well as comments and text **must** be entered in the respecive cells of this notebook. The notebook will be saved at the end of the lab session and uploaded / submitted to moodle. Please do not forget this **submission** as otherwise the assignment will not be considered as being solved! \n",
    "\n",
    "During the assignment session you may look at former notebooks and use the internet. Talking to other students and cooperation as well as the use of phone, email and any other communication means is **not allowed**!\n"
